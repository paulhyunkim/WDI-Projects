#FizzBuzz (RSpec for Ruby)

###What are we doing?

- Showing off RSpec in a simplified environment (Ruby, not Rails) before we launch into Rails applications.
- Practicing writing tests and then code.

###Why are we doing this?

(Unit) Testing is important!

- Validate as you code
- **Write tests, then write code to pass those tests**
- Save time debugging
- Carefully consider your use cases
- Write only the code you need
- Write more thoughtful code

*Testing is a skill that gets you hired!!!*

###The FizzBuzz Problem

FizzBuzz is a classic computer science problem based on a children's game. It works like this:

- Every number divisible by 3 is replaced with the word "fizz"

	1
	
	2
	
	fizz **<---- 3**
	
	4
	
	5
	
	fizz **<---- 6**
	
	7
	
	8
	
	fizz **<---- 9** 
	
	10
	 
	etc.
	
	
- Every number divisible by 5 is replaced with the word "buzz"

	1
	
	2
	
	fizz **<---- 3**
	
	4
	
	buzz **<---- 5**
	
	fizz **<---- 6**
	
	7
	
	8
	
	fizz **<---- 9** 
	
	buzz **<---- 10** 
	 
	etc.
	
	
- Every number divisible by both 3 and 5 isâ€¦"fizzbuzz"!
	So, for the range 10 - 18:

	buzz **<---- 10**
	
	11
	
	fizz **<---- 12**
	
	13
	
	14
	
	fizzbuzz **<---- 15**
	
	16
	
	17
	
	fizz **<---- 18**
	
	
	
###Got it? Awesome!

##Let's make a spec

####Housekeeping type things
- Download [fizz_buzz.rb](fizz_buzz.rb). That's your starter code. Pop it into a directory called **fizzbuzz** (just like this one!).
- Make sure you've got the RSpec gem installed (```$ gem install rspec```)**.
- Set up colors and such with your super rad .rspec file so you can watch those passing tests fly by in awesome bright green.

** When we do this in Rails, you'll want to bring that gem into your Gemfile. This exercise is just for plain Ruby.


####Let's go!
- We're going to build our first test (and make it pass) together.
- Okay, maybe our first three tests.
- You're going to finish it out (and demo your findings!). [Go here for instructions](https://github.com/ga-students/WDI_LA_5-6/blob/master/04-week/fizz_buzz/fizz_buzz_ruby_lab.md)
- Work in teams!

####Check your work

- We'll push our solution this afternoon.

#Angular Directives

Directives are (1) one of the most critical elements to AngularJS and (2) often the most misunderstood. We're going to try to clear these up, and we'll practice using built-in Angular directives. (Custom directives == a specialized lesson we'll tackle near the end of the course.)

One way to think of directives is as **reusable web components**. Your content (as shown in the browser) is updated based on data. Directives are very flexible, and once you master how to use them, you can accomplish a great deal. It's one of the reasons we dig Angular so much!

**Best practice bonus:** directives with only one job are the most reusable, and therefore the most generally useful. For example, ```ng-repeat``` exists only to handle repetition, not anything else. We love that! [Insert ```you had ONE JOB!``` joke here.]

##Angular directives canâ€¦

- be used as HTML element attributes ```<div complete></div>```
- be used as HTML elements ```<complete></complete>```
- be used as class names ```<div class="complete"></div>```
- be used as comments ```<!-- directive: complete -->```


**Best practice bonus:** it's recommended to focus on those first two (attributes and elements) and less on classes and comments. If there's a possibility that your users will be on older browsers (IE6 and such), avoid using element directives, too -- their custom element recognition is pretty abysmal.

##A quick syntax note about the hyphenated-words and camelCase

- hyphenated-words show up in the declaration, like so: ```<div i-am-a-directive</div>```
- camelCase is used in the directive definition, like so: ```App.directive('iAmADirective', function() {... });```

##Know your built-ins

Angular comes with several built-in directives. These are some key built-ins that you'll probably encounter fairly often:

- **ngApp / ng-app** -- bootstraps Angular onto your app
- **ngBind / ng-bind** -- replaces contents of an HTML element with the value of the selected expression / updates when that expression changes
- **ngClass / ng-class** -- allows dynamic setting of classes on an HTML element via bound expression 
- **ngClick / ng-click** -- triggers a custom action (function) on click
- **ngController / ng-controller** -- assigns the controller of your choice to a section of code
- **ngModel / ng-model** -- binds an input (or other form controls, like select, textarea, etc) to a property on the scope
- **ngRepeat / ng-repeat** -- loops over a structure (like an array) and executes an instance of the selected code once per item
- **ngStyle / ng-style** -- conditionally sets style on an HTML element
